# USA MAP
### A Map of the Personal Spending per Capita of the United States, for a US History assignment

Thereâ€™s more utility with the map (like hovering over states to get the precise info, and zooming in or out to take a closer look) if you open the PIbS.html file in a browser.

## Key / Explanation
The content represented is the personal income per capita of each state. It is calculated by taking the total state personal income in the first quarter of 2023 reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and dividing by the estimated population of each state as of July 2022 (the latest time for which there was an estimate). This provides an approximation for the Personal Income per Capita for each state.

The legend is on the top right of the map.
